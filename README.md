# React Server Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run a development server for a React project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js:** Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
- **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm is included with Node.js installation.
- **Note for Windows Users:** 
    Ensure that the npm command is added to your PATH environment variable. You can do this by following the instructions provided during the Node.js installation process or manually add the npm bin directory to your PATH.
- **Adding npm to the PATH on Windows**
To use npm (Node Package Manager) from any directory in your command prompt or PowerShell on Windows, you need to add the npm binary directory to your system's PATH environment variable. Here's how you can do it
- **Find the npm Installation Path:**
npm is typically installed alongside Node.js. The default installation path for npm is: C:\Program Files\nodejs 
- **Open Advanced System Settings:**
Click on the Start button and search for "System".
Select "System" from the search results. This will open the System Properties window.
- **Access Environment Variables:**
In the System Properties window, click on the "Advanced" tab, then click on the "Environment Variables..." button near the bottom of the window.
- **Edit the PATH Variable:**
In the "System Variables" section, find the variable named "Path" and select it.
Click on the "Edit..." button to modify the variable.
- **Add the npm Installation Path to the PATH:**
Click on the "New" button to add a new entry to the PATH.
Enter the npm installation path into the input field. For example, "C:\Program Files\nodejs".
Click "OK" to save the modification.
- **Apply the Changes:**
Close all the settings windows by clicking "OK".
To apply the changes, either restart your computer or open a new command prompt or PowerShell window.
- **END**
After following these steps, you should be able to use the npm command from any directory in your Windows system. You can verify that the configuration was applied correctly by opening a new command prompt or PowerShell window and typing npm -v. If the command returns the installed version of npm, then everything is set up correctly.
